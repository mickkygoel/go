# BlankScreenApp

A minimal SwiftUI iOS application that renders a blank, system-colored screen. This project was created manually to provide a simple starting point for further development.

## Requirements
- Xcode 15 or later
- iOS 16.0 deployment target

## Getting Started
1. Open `BlankScreenApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select an iOS simulator or connected device.
3. Build and run the project.

The app's `ContentView` simply fills the screen with the system background color and ignores the safe area to ensure a full-bleed appearance.
